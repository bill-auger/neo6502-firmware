Additional notes

1) 	to run BASIC from WozMon use the 'N' command.
2) 	to use the SDCard make sure the NMI, RST and IRQ switches on the board are OFF on version B otherwise it won't work !

Environment

Arch Linux. Sublime Text is the editor,  ARM GCC v13.2, Python 3.11.6 with PIL/Pillow installed (does the graphics conversion stuff). 
64tass does the 6502 assembly. CMake 3.28.1 Gnu Make 4.4.1 (though it doesn't do anything clever !). 
Documentation is mostly libreoffice. Hardware is a i5-4690 with 16Gb of RAM, most of the uploading uses a Pico based debugger from 
"The Pi Hut" which I think is a standard design. A Raspi Keyboard with USB hub, a SanDisk USB3.1 key and 
Olimex's SDCard device are permanently plugged in. You can't use both at once but they don't seem to upset each other.
