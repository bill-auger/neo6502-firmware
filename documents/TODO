TODO List
---------

General
-------

	- Working release is dependent on USB Flash progress.
			SDCard should be a backup if at all possible as can block UEXT SPI usage.

	- The peculiar LoadROM bug, currently worked round. Now resets on reload
			so now only loaded at boot.

	- Current clock 6.25 Mhz, this may be reduced if some board can't cope.

	- Possible listing corruption bug (emulator) ? Cannot reproduce.
