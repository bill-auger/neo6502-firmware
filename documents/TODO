TODO List
---------

General
-------

	- Working release is dependent on USB Flash progress.
			SDCard should be a backup if at all possible as can block UEXT SPI usage.

	- The peculiar LoadROM bug, currently worked round. Now resets on reload
			so now only loaded at boot.

	- Current clock 6.25 Mhz, this may be reduced if some board can't cope.

	- Possible listing corruption bug (emulator) ? Cannot reproduce.

Larger Additions
----------------

	- Sprites 
		- something like AMAL 

	- Tiles
		- Eris style tilemap command ?
			TILEMAP xScreen,yScreen,tileWidth,tileHeight,xOffset,yOffset,mapData
			mapData : [width] [height] [tiles]
		- Checking for monocolour and blank tile images which can be drawn much faster.

	- Turtle Graphics System		
		- Use sprite $7F

	- Add USB Joystick interface if stable.

	- Sweet16 code run on the RP2040 and baby assembler for it :)
