TODO List
---------

General
-------
- Working release is dependent on USB Flash progress.
		SDCard should be a backup if at all possible as can block UEXT SPI usage.
- The peculiar LoadROM bug, currently worked round. Now resets on reload
		so now only loaded at boot.
- Current clock 6.25 Mhz, this may be reduced if some board can't cope.
  
To next release
---------------

			SOUND CLEAR (silence, clear queue all)
