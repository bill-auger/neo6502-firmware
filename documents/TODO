TODO List
---------

General
-------
- Working release is dependent on USB Flash progress.
		SDCard should be a backup if at all possible as can block UEXT SPI usage.
- The peculiar LoadROM bug, currently worked round. Now resets on reload
		so now only loaded at boot.
- Current clock 5.61 Mhz, can optimise this slightly.
  (would be nice to get to F256 speed of 6.29 Mhz probably out of reach)
