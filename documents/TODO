TODO List
---------

General
-------

	- Working release is dependent on USB Flash progress.
			SDCard should be a backup if at all possible as can block UEXT SPI usage.

	- The peculiar LoadROM bug, currently worked round. Now resets on reload
			so now only loaded at boot.

	- Current clock 6.25 Mhz, this may be reduced if some board can't cope.
  
Next Coding
-----------	

	- SPRITE CLEAR issue.

	- Stop off screen sprites causing an error

	- Trim sprites properly.
	
	- Start the code review.

  	- SLIDE

	- Graphics system

		- Sprites 
				- Optimise Sprite code (maybe ?)
				- something like AMAL 
				- Changeable anchor points.
		- Tiles
				- Eris style tilemap command ?

		- Turtle Graphics System

	- Add USB Joystick interface if stable.
