TODO List
---------

General
-------
- Working release is dependent on USB Flash progress.
		SDCard should be a backup if at all possible as can block UEXT SPI usage.
- The peculiar LoadROM bug, currently worked round. Now resets on reload
		so now only loaded at boot.
- Current clock 6.25 Mhz, this may be reduced if some board can't cope.
  
To next release
---------------

	- Audio system interface
	- Rebuild Windows Emulator
	- Rebuild, upload via UF2 etc. and check it all is working.

Next Coding
-----------	
	- Neaten the logo which is a bit frayed.
	- Config load not working ???? Not present ?
  	- User defined font 
	- Graphics system
		- Sprites 
				- Optimise Sprite code (maybe ?)
				- something like AMAL 
				- Changeable anchor points.
		- Tiles
	- Add USB Joystick interface if stable.
	- Sweet16 code run on the RP2040 and baby assembler for it :)
