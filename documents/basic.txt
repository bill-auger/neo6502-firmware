Tokenising
==========

00-1F xx 	Offset into identifier table, points to offset 1.
20-3F  		Binary Operator tokens.
40-7F 		6 bit shift for constant.
80-AF 		unary tokens
B0-FF 		standard tokens

Identifier
==========

+0 			Offset to next, or zero.

+1..4 		Value of variable		

+5 			Control byte.
				bit 7,6 	00 float 	01 integer 	10 string 	11 procedure
				bit 5 		Variable (Reference)
				bit 4 		Array
				
+6+ 		ASCII name of variable, bit 7 set of last. Stored in upper case.

Total size = 6 + len(name). Expands when this value is >= $FC, so it will
allocate extra space, but only once.

Graphics structure
==================
+0 		File type (1)
+1 		# of 16x16 tiles (numbered from $80)
+2 		# of 16x16 sprites (numbered from $80)
+3 		# of 32x32 sprites (numbered from $C0)
+4..15 	Not used
+16 	First tile (stored consecutively)


Sprites
-------
		state :
			visible  	0
			position	$FFFF both   
			image # <composite of image and size in bit 6> $FF not drawable.
			(actually drawn)
			(offset to top left, both size/2)
			(size, for checking bounds & drawing)
			(image address)

SPRITE CLEAR

SPRITE <n> TO|BY <x,y> IMAGE <n> FLIP <n> DIM <s> 		Draws the current sprite, showing it.
	   HIDE 											Makes it invisible

HIT(n,n,d)

6,1 	reset sprites, clear screen
6,2 	update <n> x[2] y[2] image & size[1] flip[1] and show -ve values fail. 
6,3 	hide <n>
