Tokenising
==========

00-1F xx 	Offset into identifier table, points to offset 1.
20-3F  		Binary Operator tokens.
40-7F 		6 bit shift for constant.
80-AF 		unary tokens
B0-FF 		standard tokens

Identifier
==========

+0 			Offset to next, or zero.

+1..4 		Value of variable		

+5 			Control byte.
				bit 7,6 	00 float 	01 integer 	10 string 	11 procedure
				bit 5 		Variable (Reference)
				bit 4 		Array
				
+6+ 		ASCII name of variable, bit 7 set of last. Stored in upper case.

Total size = 6 + len(name). Expands when this value is >= $FC, so it will
allocate extra space, but only once.

Graphics structure
==================
+0 		File type (1)
+1 		# of 16x16 tiles (numbered from $80)
+2 		# of 16x16 sprites (numbered from $80)
+3 		# of 32x32 sprites (numbered from $C0)
+4..255 Not used
+256 	First tile (stored consecutively)
