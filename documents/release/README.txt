Release Notes
-------------

This is an initial testing/tinkering release. You can't do much with it. 

It has WozMon Fig-Forth and Apple 1 Integer BASIC built in.

FORTH is started with 400R, BASIC with E000R 

File save/load doesn't exist on either.

Note : WozMon works the same, but the address vectors are different. See the API Documentation. So the example printing programs won't
work. 

It has only been tested on Release A ; I hope to get a Release B board RSN as Olimex have sent my order.

Even though you can't see it or access it, the graphics and sound are working. There is no storage yet (same Olimex order !)

There is also an emulator which I am trying to keep in parallel so far successfully. Much of the same code is reused in the emulator
so this shouldn't be a challenge. If I write graphics routines for the firmware it should just work.

All suggestions are welcome.
