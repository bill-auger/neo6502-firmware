Release Notes
-------------

This is a more advanced version, save/load works, the NeoBasic is implemented (no sound/graphics yet) and Apple 1 BASIC
and Fig FORTH have been removed.

BASIC is booted via 'N' or 800R. There is a short documentation as a pdf/odt file available and some sample code in the
samples

All suggestions are welcome.
